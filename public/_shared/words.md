# about

My work is about taking things that are complex and making them understandable. Whether through graphics, copywriting, interaction or technology—the work is done in whatever mode will resonate greatest. This accounts for my experience in many forms of design: from print to UX to front-end developer.

Patternworks is the solo, independent design consultancy of Callum Flack.

In 2010, after a decade as a graphic designer, I learnt to code because UI is software, so designers should know how to program.

Design is an aggregation of choices. By learning to implement these choices in the digital medium, I discover how things work and I retain design precision.

We build digital brands, experiences and campaigns for every screen.

We create websites and apps that make it really easy for people to interact with you
We create websites and apps that fast, easy and delightful for people to use.

//- _Technology matters._ If you don’t understand the materials you are working with, you can’t build the right thing, even if you go about it in the right way. You can’t build what you can’t think of in the first place.

//- _Design matters._ Design is the interface between technology and people. Digital productivity is not a technology problem, it's a human problem. People come first, then technology.

h3 If I was already a designer, why also learn to code?
p By being able to build what I can conceptualise, I deeply understand how brand, usability and technical domains interplay. This helps me to think in systems instead of pages, to turn blind spots into opportunity and to stack up the small details that make big differences to digital products and services.

//- h3 What are the steps involved in a project?
//- h3 A process is necessarily a collaboration
//- h3 A process of collaboration
h3 My process is collaboration
p Work engagement begins by auditing current communications, roadmapping your digital brand's future and defining a strategy together. The resulting mix of market, technology, and business requirements are weighed against time and budget to obtain an agreed scope of work.

p The process is divided into logical steps and is done iteratively and—most importantly—in collaboration.

//- h3 How can I help product teams to breakthrough?
//- p With my broad skillset, I can help at almost any stage of the digital project lifecycle. Clients commonly come to me to improve existing brands or products—whether auditing or redesigning brand identities, interfaces, and user journeys, or adding, updating and fixing features in development. Or to help create new, best-in-class sites and apps from scratch.
