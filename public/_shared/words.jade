//- Patternworks plans, designs and builds websites that are fast, simple and useful. 
//- 
//- We make it really easy for your customers to do business with you, online. 
//- 
//- We work closely with our clients to understand who their customers are, and what they need. 
//- 
//- We take big picture business problems and turn them into simple, understandable and actionable user experiences. 
//- 
//- We use interaction design, graphic design, copywriting, and code to execute the stack of details required. 
//- 
//- We think great user experiences make better customer services. And that great service is worth far more than branding.
			
			
			
			
//- You can also follow our updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/patternworks_">twitter</a>.
//- _Technology matters._ If you don’t understand the materials you are working with, you can’t build the right thing, even if you go about it in the right way. You can’t build what you can’t think of in the first place.
//- 
//- _Design matters._ Design is the interface between technology and people. Digital productivity is not a technology problem, it's a human problem. People come first, then technology.
