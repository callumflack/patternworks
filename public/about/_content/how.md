## How I work

By defining goals first. Then I build, share, test, watch, listen, prod and iterate to get results. I'm multi-disciplinary: design is my core capability, and I regard my coding ability as an extension of designâ€”I build everything myself with a comprehensive knowledge of web technologies, collaborating with trusted cohorts for specific skillsets. I create for people first. Because they're the ones who make your business.
