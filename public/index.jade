				Patternworks is a digital creative workshop that plans, designs and builds better user experiences. We work closely with our clients to understand who their customers are, and what they need. 
				
				We take big picture business problems and turn them into simple, understandable and actionable stories. We use graphic design, interaction design, copywriting, and code to execute the stack of details required. We believe great user experiences will win you more fans than any form of advertising.

				Patternworks is lead by Callum Flack, working with a band of cohorts, from Cairns, far northern Australia. Since starting in 2000, Callum has worked in design studios ([Saatchi & Saatchi Design, London](http://www.saatchi-design.co.uk/sagatiba)), agencies ([GPYR, Brisbane](http://www.gpyr.com.au/) and [Ward 6, Sydney](http://www.ward6.com.au/)) and startup teams ([Box+Dice, Melbourne](http://www.boxdice.com.au/)).

	//- _Technology matters._ If you don’t understand the materials you are working with, you can’t build the right thing, even if you go about it in the right way. You can’t build what you can’t think of in the first place.

	//- _Design matters._ Design is the interface between technology and people. Digital productivity is not a technology problem, it's a human problem. People come first, then technology.
