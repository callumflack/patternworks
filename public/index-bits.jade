					//- p Patternworks is the independent digital creative studio of Callum Flack and collaborators, located in Cairns, Australia. We plan, design & build for the web.
					//- 
					//- h3 Our works are outcome focussed
					//- p Patternworks offers a wholistic approach to creating or updating digital businesses that is measurably successful and always looks good. We do this by understanding your business goals and your user's needs, planning for specific outcomes and executing detail upon detail. We believe great digital user experiences will win you more customers than any form of advertising. 
					//- 
					//- h3 About Callum
					//- p I have fifteen years experience in creative problem-solving: taking complex concepts and making them into simple, understandable and actionable stories. Whether through graphics, typography, copywriting, interaction or technology—the work is done in whatever mode will resonate. 
					//- 
					//- p I live with my wife and young family in the tropics of Cairns, far northern Australia, where I dehumidify my record collection weekly.
					//- 
					//- h3 Experienced
					//- p 
					//- 	| Since starting in 2000, I've worked in design studios 
					//- 	| (#[a(href="http://www.saatchi-design.co.uk/sagatiba") Saatchi & Saatchi Design, London]), 
					//- 	| inhouse startup teams (#[a(href="http://www.boxdice.com.au/") Box+Dice, Melbourne] and 
					//- 	| #[a(href="http://www.welend.hk/") WeLend, Hong Kong]), 
					//- 	| and advertising (#[a(href="hhttp://www.gpyr.com.au/") GPYR, Brisbane] and #[a(href="http://www.ward6.com.au/") Ward 6, Sydney]). 
					//- 	| I've also co-run a record label (#[a(href="http://www.thee-roundtable.com/") Roundtable Records]). 
					//- 	| Lots of people have said nice things about working with me. You can read a few of them on #[a(href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/callumflack") LinkedIn].
					//- 
					//- h3 If I was already a designer, why code?
					//- p By being able to build what I plan and design, I deeply understand how brand, usability and technical domains work together. This helps me to think in systems instead of web pages, to turn blind spots into opportunity and to stack up the small details that make big differences when creating great user experiences.
