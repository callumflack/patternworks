# UI
nav modal/footer:
- cursor image of 'X' on close modal areas
- don't close modal if clicked a page (currently modal closes immediately which flashes the current pg before new pg load…)
- how does nav trigger work in footer? (don't have footer?)
- if no footer, fixed header?
- nav trigger position responsively
- contact details in modal/footer: icons or text?

nav icon: 
- animate between hamburger icon and close icon: https://blog.intercom.com/
- disappear when scrolled into footer: http://jsfiddle.net/4zw0cjsu/

hero images:
- spin out all sizes / variations
- use cloudinary w/ [<picture>](http://cloudinary.com/blog/automatically_art_directed_responsive_images)?
- loader method: 
    - from OBL
    - or [postcss-resemble-image](https://github.com/ben-eb/postcss-resemble-image)? (can't really use w/ cloudinary as needs to compute the linear-gradient and save in css)

buy Styrene.

Fear of failure:

In professional life, you must discover a kind of identity for yourself, that becomes a sort of trademark, a way of working that is distinctive that people can recognize. The reason for this is that the path to financial success and notoriety is by having something that no-one else has. It’s kind of like a brand, one of my most despised words.
