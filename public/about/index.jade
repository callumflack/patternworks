            p I have fifteen years experience in creative problem-solving: taking complex concepts and making them into simple, understandable and actionable stories. Whether through graphics, typography, copywriting, interaction or technology—the work is done in whatever mode will resonate. 
            
            p I live with my wife and young family in the tropics of Cairns, far northern Australia, where I dehumidify my record collection weekly.

                | Since starting in 2000, I've worked in design studios 
                | (#[a(href="http://www.saatchi-design.co.uk/") Saatchi & Saatchi Design, London]), 
                | inhouse startup teams (#[a(href="http://www.boxdice.com.au/") Box+Dice, Melbourne] and 
                | #[a(href="http://www.welend.hk/") WeLend, Hong Kong]), 
                | and advertising (#[a(href="hhttp://www.gpyr.com.au/") GPYR, Brisbane] and #[a(href="http://www.ward6.com.au/") Ward 6, Sydney]). 
                | I've also co-run a record label (#[a(href="http://www.thee-roundtable.com/") Roundtable Records]). 
                | Lots of people have said nice things about working with me. You can read a few of them on #[a(href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/callumflack") LinkedIn].
            
            h3 If I was already a designer, why also learn to code?
            p By being able to build what I can conceptualise, I deeply understand how brand, usability and technical domains interplay. This helps me to think in systems instead of pages, to turn blind spots into opportunity and to stack up the small details that make big differences to digital products and services.

            h3 My process is collaboration
            p Work engagement begins by auditing current communications, roadmapping your digital brand's future and defining a strategy together. The resulting mix of market, technology, and business requirements are weighed against time and budget to obtain an agreed scope of work. 
            
            p The process is divided into logical steps and is done iteratively and—most importantly—in collaboration.

            //- p With my broad skillset, I can help at almost any stage of the digital project lifecycle. Clients commonly come to me to improve existing brands or products—whether auditing or redesigning brand identities, interfaces, and user journeys, or adding, updating and fixing features in development. Or to help create new, best-in-class sites and apps from scratch.
