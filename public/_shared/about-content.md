# about

My work is about taking things that are complex and making them understandable. Whether through graphics, copywriting, interaction or technologyâ€”the work is done in whatever mode will resonate greatest. This accounts for my experience in many forms of design: from print to UX to front-end developer.

Patternworks is the solo, independent design consultancy of Callum Flack.

In 2010, after a decade as a graphic designer, I learnt to code because UI is software, so designers should know how to program.

Design is an aggregation of choices. By learning to implement these choices in the digital medium, I discover how things work and I retain design precision.

We build digital brands, experiences and campaigns for every screen.
