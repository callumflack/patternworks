            p I have fifteen years experience in problem-solving things that are complex and turning them into simple, understandable and actionable stories. Whether through graphics, typography, copywriting, interaction or technology—the work is done in whatever mode will resonate. 
            
            p I live with my wife and young family in the tropics of Cairns, far northern Australia, where I dehumidify my record collection weekly.

            h3 If I was already a designer, why also learn to code?
            p By being able to build what I can conceptualise, I understand deeply how brand, usability and technical domains interplay. This helps me design for purpose and systems instead of impressions and style, to turn blind spots into opportunity and to stack up the small details that make big differences to digital products and services.
            
            p Like most learning efforts, it began with disappointment. The standard of the digital projects I was involved at the time were subpar. So I decided—without any prior programming experience—to learn how to build interfaces myself. The rewards have far outweighed the pain, and introduced me to new ways of thinking about the world.

            h3 My process is collaboration
            p Work engagement begins by auditing current communications, discussing possibilities with a roadmapping session and defining a strategy together. The resulting mix of market, technology, and business requirements are weighed against time and budget to obtain an agreed scope of work. 
            
            p The process is divided into logical steps and is done iteratively and—importantly—in partnership with you. 

            p Here's a quick list of things I can do:

            h3 How can I help product teams to breakthrough?
            p With my broad skillset, I can help at almost any stage of the digital project lifecycle. Clients commonly come to me to improve existing brands or products—whether auditing or redesigning brand identities, interfaces, and user journeys, or adding, updating and fixing features in development. Or to help create new, best-in-class sites and apps from scratch.
