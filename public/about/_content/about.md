## About us

We're a digital design workshop located in Cairns, far northern Australia. Our passion is solving complex business problems using interaction design, graphic design, copywriting, code and grit to make simple, actionable customer experiences.

Patternworks is owned and lead by Callum Flack, who has 16 years experience working in London, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and now Cairns. Lots of people have said nice things about working with him. You can read a few of them on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/callumflack).
